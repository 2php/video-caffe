Just to remind myself (Chuck) some of the ongoing/undone work for Caffe+C3D merge
- make sure to do regression test with previous 4D blobs without length (or depth) 
  (n*c*h*w) -- DONE
- python wrapper
- check crop vs resize -- DONE
- misc tools: e.g. computer volume mean, extract c3d features
- check (N, C, W, H) vs (N, C, L, W, H) -- DONE
- params _h and _w don't work as intended yet -- DONE
- CUDNN supports 2dim convolution only -- clean wrapper for applying CPU /
  non-CUDNN CUDA / CUDNN for 2dim/ndim conv -- DONE
- Make sure changes in these are safe: blob.cpp,hpp, im2col_layer.cpp

WORK TO DO
- make sure all tests pass -- DONE
- merge into dextro-research/Vision -- IN REVIEW
- python
- regression test (older models should work) -- ONGOING
- when everything's done, remove print-out's, debug msgs
