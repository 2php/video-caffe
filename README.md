# Caffe with C3D implementation and video reader

This is 3-D Convolution (C3D) and video reader implementation in the latest Caffe (as of Feb 2016). The original [Facebook C3D implementation](https://github.com/facebook/C3D/) is branched out from Caffe on July 17, 2014 with git_id [b80fc86](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/b80fc862952ba4e068cf74acc0823785ce1cc0e9), and has not been rebased with the original Caffe hence missing out quite a few new features in the lastest Caffe. I therefore tried to pull in C3D concept and also an accompanying video reader and apply to the latest Caffe. Please reach [me](https://github.com/chuckcho) for any feedback or question. Thank you.

Check out the [original Caffe readme](README-original.md) for Caffe-specific information.
